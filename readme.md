# TicTacToe

Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game running with [websockets](https://github.com/websockets/ws). Frontend made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Pug](https://pugjs.org), and [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/). Backend built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

_I would recommend running these commands in parallel in two seperate terminals_

```zsh
yarn dev    # hot reload frontend using parcel.js
yarn serve  # hot reload backend using nodemon + babel-node
```
